# Sample Data






This directory contains sample XML data that can be used to test Hybrasyl and 
login to the world. You can copy the subdirectories here into `world/xml`, in 
Hybrasyl's data directory (e.g. `My Documents\Hybrasyl\world\xml`). You will 
need the map files `lod500.map` and `lod136.map` which should be placed in the 
world directory as well, in `mapfiles` (e.g. `Hybrasyl\world\mapfiles`). Your 
data directory should look like the structure indicated in the project 
[README](https://github.com/hybrasyl/server/blob/master/README.md).
